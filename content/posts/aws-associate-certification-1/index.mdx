<Text sx={{ fontStyle: `italic`, fontSize: [1]}}>
  Side story - as I have mentioned in the last blog, I was planning to write something about TDD.<br />
  As I started to do more research and read over 30 articles, I realized I needed to perform more research on the subject.<br />
  I understand and genuinely like the idea of TDD, but BDD and ATDD appear to be much more useful and are a big step closer to the way humans think...) Will leave this to the actual TDD post until I do enough research to write a self-satisfying blog post.<br />
  So there is a change of plan, I will talk about TDD later.

## 1. Making the Decision to take the certification exam
> Why get certified? Why AWS? Why get certified as a solutions architect?

The reason is simply about gaining more exposure to the cloud. 
Also, it is another way to force me to gain more exposure to the cloud space and opportunities that are available to developers.

Although Azure and Google Cloud are great choices for pursuing certification, I have more experience with AWS and decided to focus on this.

### Associate level - Solutions Architect(SA) vs Developer
There are 3 kinds of certification roles at the associate-level - _Solutions Architect_, _Developer_ and _SysOps_

SysOps focuses on operations and system administration. It is irrelevant from what I have been doing so I just briefly reviewed this certificate.

I took a deeper look into the description between SA and Developer. To simplify:

- *AWS SA* 
  - Designing the best possible architecture in terms of scalability, performance and cost-effectiveness.
- *AWS Developer*
  - get to know tools that AWS provides for developers
  - in-depth exploration on building CI/CD pipelines

#### The thinking behind this

I quickly glanced over the AWS Developer materials. 
And I imagine the experience and knowledge about those developer tools and services will be acquired naturally from a company using it.

However, knowing what the existence of infrastructural products and the possibilities of system architecture are hard to acquire from work. 
Besides, the ability to design a scalable and resilient system design then build one myself is something I haven't thought of.

Therefore, I decided to go with the AWS Solutions Architect path.  
However, I will consider obtaining the AWS Developer certification in the future.

## 2. About the study plan

### Initial planned schedule

Here is a snapshot of my daily study plan:

|         |            |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 9am  - 4pm    | Study for AWS |
| 4pm   - 7pm   | Write blogs / coding practices / personal project |

I chose this time slot for studying because I believed this was the most focused time period for peak productivity.

### So on day 3...
I failed to follow the schedule already!<br />
I found that I was not productive nor as efficient as I should.<br />
And especially it is not like working in an office or with a team. <br />
It is hard to work independently and stay focused on this single task by myself.

I decided to follow my feelings in terms of what I felt like doing but the main focus is to study. <br />
Generally, it is about keeping my brain refreshed by doing something else to minimize boredom.

|         |            |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 9:30am  - 11am  | Personal project |
| 11am  - 12:30pm | Study for AWS |
 for AWS |
| 12:30pm - 1:30pm | Lunch |
| 1:30pm  - 2pm   | Write some blogs |
| 2pm - 4:30pm    | Study for AWS |
| 4:30pm - 5pm    | Write some blogs / Personal interest project |
| 5pm - 7pm       | Study for AWS |

Well, but of course, for the 3 days before the exam, the schedule looks like:

|         |            |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 9:30am  - 11pm  | StudyStudyStudyStudyStudy |


### Some old fashioned learning tricks for the modern days
Here are some other tricks that may help.

#### Morning is important - Do not look at your phone

The philosophy behind this is that morning is the most energetic and most productive time for our brain. <br />
This is when we are the most comfortable and motivated to do unsatisfying tasks, ie. work and study. <br />
If I want to stay productive and focused, I will keep thinking about the plan of the day in the morning then execute it later.

You may find yourself not being that productive if you spent some time on social media websites(facebook, instagram, 9gag etc.) after you wake up. My advice is just leave it until the evening (I even stopped using them during the last few days before the exam. ).<br />
My advice is just to leave it until the evening (I even stopped using them these days).

#### Then what should I do?
My advise - plan the day ahead, inside your head.ðŸ˜Œ <br />
While I am having breakfast or commuting, I rehearsed in my head about which website I will first tab on my browser and where have I left off last night.<br />
It's a trick picked up from performing band gigs and preparing for job interviews.<br />
By doing so, you won't get lost from task to task. And thus, preventing yourself from landing on social websites or memes again.

Besides, I always keep in mind this important tip:
> Boredom sparks creativity.

And creativity is not just about art or designs, but also great ideas on solving problems and performing better.

#### Review how you have performed
I happen to come across this [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) app and I gave it a shot.<br />
Then I found it really useful since it shows me the breakdown of how well my study plan went.<br />
The satisfaction is being able to plan and then execute it is very successful.

Here is a screenshot of one of my days.
![](./rescuetime.png)
At first, it showed me how I have been distracted by messages, emails, calls and banking statements which gave me a very good hint on what to improve on.<br />
It is also satisfying to see how well you have changed and performed better gradually.

The trial version is long enough to try it out properly.<br />
It cannot track whether you are away or daydreaming, but at least you have not switched to 9gag and endlessly browsing memes.<br />
I did not subscribe at last because I feel like I have adjusted my schedule during the trial version.

## 3. About the certification - It's like biology
When you first learn biology, you think you know how each part of your body works.<br />
However, you would gradually be amazed when you are studying that. "Wow! It does that." "I thought I knew it."

The same applies to me while studying AWS.<br />
I have used some of the on-premise hardware but AWS interpreted the philosophy of why we are using certain components with a few more perspectives.<br />
This results in adding more terminology to my memorization list.<br />
With that said, try to approach your studying with a fresh mind, in other words, assume you do not know anything about the product. 

### Choosing the right course and lecturer that feels right

It's no longer the 80s where we are restricted to live in class lectures with the same professor.<br />
There are different courses and lecturers we can choose from.<br />
Some courses include free trials, such as Udemy, which allow the student to refund within 30 days of taking the course.

So if you think you don't think you can follow the lecture after an hour or two, just try another one which may make your learning more efficient.<br />
(With that said, I have only refunded a course about TDD as I was trying to look for advanced materials.)

Well, I am not saying we should just dump a course that easily.<br />
But there are different approaches to learning one subject and there are probably better ones that may be more of a better fit for you.  

#### How I picked it
I purchased 2 courses for AWS solutions architect courses.<br />
One of them is very exam-focused and one takes care of the exam but also includes practical topics and professional sharing.<br />
These particular sections make me feel like I am learning to be a solutions architect.<br />
So I picked the latter as the primary course line to rely on since I want more exposure to becoming a solutions architect.

### Keep a pen and papers around you

Solutions architecture  is about how you form a concrete system design from scratch. <br />
To learn faster, try to first draw a system diagram before proceeding to watch some system architecture instructions.

There are too many choices of services or devices in AWS for you to pick from and the abbreviations are very similar such as ELB,EBS, and ASG.<br />
My understanding of those components was reinforced when I was trying to draw that on paper.<br />
For every single line, I would analyze and sometimes google to see if they could connect to each other.<br />
Besides, I believe I will be using the same approach in the future.

### 3/9 Update: I passed the exam 
#### Quick tips
Don't worry about trying to do loads of AWS exam dumps.<br />
For me, the practice exam from Udemy was very helpful! They were actually more difficult than the AWS exam.<br />
Oh, but that's not the point. The exam questions and situations keep changing. <br />

The exam questions and situations keep changing.<br />
All you need is to understand how the exam is trying to trick you.<br />
And those tricks can only be resolved if you read(listen) carefully to what the problem is and understand the differences between various  AWS components.<br />
Therefore, before the day of the exam, have a good night's sleep and use your well-rested brain to read through the questions carefully to excel in the exam. <br />

Good night and all the best!
