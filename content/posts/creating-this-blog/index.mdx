I now unemployed and trying to do some personal work and studying. Then I decided to create my own blog to log all these down in the coming month(s) *hope not*.

However, building this blog took as I thought. 
There were too many new blog buildng options that are new to me. And I want to take a quick look on most of them as many as possible.

## The decision journey

### Choice of platform
To start with, I must find a kind of technology to work at.

**First thought about:**
- *Google Blogger* - limited flexibility and third-party themes are mostly outdated
- *All-in-one Website builder* - expensive subscription and lack of theme choices
- *Wordpress* - I have been working with them for long time. Great numbers of themes but always end up tweaking them and it's not easy.
- *Medium*
  - I read on Medium, a lot. People write on there is more like publishing their work or astounding thoughts. But I just want a space where I can customise stuffs and play with cool effects from time to time.

So I gave up on canned solutions to customise my own site.
Numbers of choices are still huge! But I limited down to 2 static site generators base on trends and recent blog post numbers - GatsbyJS and Hugo.

**GatsbyJS - built with React and GraphQL**
- Good chance to practice on React and GraphQL
- Great numbers of plugins and themes

**Hugo - written in Go**
- Good chance to study Go
- Extreme rendering speed
- But no support in JavaScript at all ðŸ¤”

##### The communities

According to some comparison posts, both had the same size community last year. But now the Gatsby community seems to have outreached Hugoâ€™s. 
I have compared the communities of Gatsby and Hugo.

|  | Gatsby | Hugo  |
| -- |-------------|-----|
| **Questions on StackOverflow**  | 3600        | 700         |
| **Issues on Github**            | 11000       | 4800        |

> Here is another good reference - [Live figures](https://www.staticgen.com/)  from Netlify.

##### Support for Javascript

Also, I am tempted intrigued to add a lot of cool effects into my blog.
There are many interesting plugins and useful tools available [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/).

Obviously, *Gatsby becomes the winner* base on its extensibility and features. 

*(One more personal reason is GraphQL is getting more popular these days. <br/>This would be a great place for me practice with the language.)*

### Choice of hosts (with automated deployment)

There are a lot of tools that could automatically render, deploy and host websites straight from a Github repo.
I do not want to overkill for simply just a blog with cloud configurations right now.

So I looked down to Netlify and Github Pages as they seem to be the simplest for continuous deployment.

#### Netlify vs Github Pages
Netlify provides friendly drag& drop interfaces, giant data handling and thumbnail generation.
Github Pages on the other hand just comes out of Github and is widely used.

I should pick Github here since I don't actually need much from the Netlify features.
However, I deceided to go with Netlify purely for experiment.
Allegedly it is one of the common CI/CD tool allegedly which may widen my vision on gaining visions on more products in the market.

### Other considerations

**Domain name seller**

Itâ€™s all about security and price so not much I could mention. And I donâ€™t really worry about my domain getting stolen anyway.

**Domain name of my blog**

I have struggled between `waynehk.dev`, `waynedev.hk` or `waynedev.blog`.
Then, I found the `.me` top-level domain and I just went straight ahead as it fits exactly my purpose.

## Review on the experience
*Since I was a developer evangelist, I am now being sensitive on the learning curve of acquiring a new technology.*

### Gatsby & Shadowing
The learning journey of Gatsby is very satisfying. 
The tutorial is easy to follow with over-explaining instructions, code blocks and screenshots.
You do not really need to know any ReactJS before jumping into it.

**Twisting the theme - Shadowing**

Shadowing is a concept of Gatsby allowing others to make changes on an installed theme - which is similar to class overriding in Java. 
The only thing that comes messy is I have to look for the theme sourcecode and create the exact code path of the file I want to override. 

Other than that, there is not reason to not love how easy a theme or plugin can be twisted.

### Netlify & Netlify CMS
The setup for automated deployment is just a few clicks and granting access on Github which is very smooth and I would recommend this to others.
However, it is not free for multiple accounts.

I probably would add Netlify CMS to create blog entries next.
Actually I have managed to set it up once but messed up to migrate it to my current project. 
But I will just leave it for now and get started on learning some backend tech as I wanted asap.

I think this is a good catchup with React and new web-development technogies.

**Next up** - will be my recent experience with Test-Driven-Technology.
