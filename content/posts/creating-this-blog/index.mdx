Building this blog took much longer than I thought. 
The reason is there were too many new blog buildng options that are new to me! 
And I took a quick look on all viable options as many as possible.

This is the journey that I struggled happily as I learnt a lot.

## The decision journey

### Choosing the right platform

The first decision is to evaluate the right platform to implement. I narrowed down my choices to the following:
- *[Google Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)* - limited flexibility and third-party themes are mostly outdated
- *[All-in-one Website builder](https://hk.godaddy.com/en/websites/website-builder/plans-and-pricing)* - expensive subscription and lack of theme choices
- *[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)* - I have been working with them for long time. Great numbers of themes but always end up tweaking them and it's not easy.
- *[Medium](https://medium.com/)*
  - I read on Medium, a lot. People write on there is more like publishing their work or astounding thoughts. But I just want a space where I can customise stuffs and play with cool effects from time to time.

After reviewing the canned solutions, I decided to customize my own site. 
Although there many choices, I narrowed down my selection to 2 static site generators based on evaluating trends and recent blog posts: GatsbyJS and Hugo 

**[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - built with React and GraphQL**
- Good chance to practice on React and GraphQL
- Great numbers of plugins and themes

**[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - written in Go**
- Good chance to study Go
- Extreme rendering speed
- But no support in JavaScript at all ðŸ¤”

##### The communities
According to some developer posts, both solutions had the same numbers of developers last year. 
However, this past year the number of Gatsby developers exceed the number of Hugo developers.
The following is a comparison of communities of both platforms:

|  | Gatsby | Hugo  |
| -- |-------------|-----|
| **Questions on StackOverflow**  | 3600        | 700         |
| **Issues on Github**            | 11000       | 4800        |

> Here is another good reference - [Live figures](https://www.staticgen.com/) from Netlify.

##### Support for Javascript
Obviously, Gastby is the winner due to the extensive features.
I am also inspired to add a lot of cool effects into my blog.

There are many interesting plugins and useful tools available [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/).

Obviously, *Gatsby becomes the winner* base on its extensibility and features. 

(One more reason for choosing Gatsby is GraphQL. GraphQL is gaining quite a bit of traction within the developer communities.<br/> 
This will also give me the opportunity to learn the language.)

### Choice of hosts (with automated deployment)

There are a lot of tools that could automatically render, deploy and host websites straight from a Github repo.  
However, I believe it would be a complete overkill to use these tools for a blog site with the cloud configurations available now. 

So I looked down to Netlify and Github Pages as they seem to be the simplest for continuous deployment.

#### Netlify vs Github Pages
Netlify provides friendly drag& drop interfaces, giant data handling and thumbnail generation.
Github Pages on the other hand just comes out of Github and is widely used.

I should pick Github here since I don't actually need much from the Netlify features.
However, I deceided to go with Netlify purely for experiment.
Allegedly it is one of the common CI/CD tool allegedly which may widen my vision on gaining visions on more products in the market.

### Other considerations

**Domain name seller**

There is not much discussion needed as Itâ€™s all about security and price. Also, I'm not worried about my domain getting stolen.

**Domain name of my blog**

I have struggled between `waynehk.dev`, `waynedev.hk` or `waynedev.blog`.
Then, I found the `.me` top-level domain and I just went straight ahead as it fits exactly my purpose.

## Review on the experience
*Since I was a developer evangelist, I am now being sensitive on the learning curve of acquiring a new technology.*

### Gatsby & Shadowing
The learning journey of Gatsby is quite satisfying. 
The tutorial is easy to follow with step-by-step instructions, code blocks and screenshots. 
You do not really need to know any ReactJS before jumping into it.


**Twisting the theme - Shadowing**

Shadowing is a concept of Gatsby allowing others to make changes on an installed theme - which is similar to class overriding in Java. 
The only thing that comes messy is I have to look for the theme sourcecode and create the exact code path of the file I want to override. 

Other than that, there is not reason to not love how easy a theme or plugin can be twisted.

### Netlify & Netlify CMS
The setup for automated deployment is just a few clicks and granting access on Github which is very smooth and I would recommend this to others.
However, it is not free for multiple accounts.

I probably would add Netlify CMS to create the blog entries. 
Actually I have managed to set it up once but came across some challenges trying to migrate it to my current project. 
But I will just leave it for now and get started on building some backend tech.

I hope you found this blog to be a helpful overview and a good catchup with React and new web-development technologies.
