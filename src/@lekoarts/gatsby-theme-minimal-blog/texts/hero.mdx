>Hoping to swallow all technical knowledge

```java:title=DailyRoutine
while(true){

  try(InputStream input = Wayne.getBrainInputStream()){}

    Set<Knowledge> knowledge = queryFromWorld("SELECT * FROM Technology");
    Wayne.swallow(knowledge);

  } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {

    Coffee coffee = getSingleOrDoppio(Wayne.getStatus());
    Wayne.consume(coffee);

  }
}

I want to acquire ideas that are more solid and presentable.<br/>And this is the journey where I start.
