This is my learning blog about catching up the new technologies.


I have been working as a backend developer for years but the technology has been moving so fast.
Spring boot had just been released when I was graduated. Now it becomes an unneglectable skill for Java developers.

Maybe I am left way behind but this is the journey where I catch up.
